## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@example.com](mailto:contact@example.com).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB
- Neo4j
- Redis

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ultimate-project-hub.git
   cd ultimate-project-hub
   ```
3. Add the original repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/ultimate-project-hub.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd src/backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cp src/backend/.env.example src/backend/.env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration

   # Frontend
   cp src/frontend/.env.example src/frontend/.env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```
6. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend server
   cd src/backend
   npm run dev

   # Start frontend server
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-you-are-fixing
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the [coding standards](#coding-standards)

3. Write or update tests as necessary

4. Run tests to ensure they pass:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature" # for features
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with X" # for bug fixes
   git commit -m "docs: update README" # for documentation
   git commit -m "refactor: improve code structure" # for refactoring
   ```

6. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Create a Pull Request from your fork to the original repository

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR includes a clear description of the changes and the purpose
2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Include screenshots or examples if applicable
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards
6. Request a review from maintainers
7. Address any feedback from reviewers

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Follow the ESLint configuration provided in the project
- Use TypeScript types and interfaces
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use ES6+ features when appropriate

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper component composition
- Follow the React hooks rules
- Use React context for state that needs to be accessed by many components

### CSS/Styling

- Follow the Tailwind CSS conventions
- Use utility classes when possible
- Create custom components for repeated patterns
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Write component tests for React components
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical functionality

## Documentation

- Update README.md with any necessary changes
- Document new features or changes in behavior
- Add JSDoc comments to functions and components
- Update API documentation for backend changes
- Create or update examples as needed
