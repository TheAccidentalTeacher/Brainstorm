3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability:
   - The type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix if available

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability:

1. You'll receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours.
2. We'll investigate and determine the impact and severity of the issue.
3. We'll work on a fix and keep you updated on our progress.
4. Once the issue is resolved, we'll publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

### Security Update Process

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions.
4. Release new versions and update the security advisory.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

When contributing to this project, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure proper access controls are in place.
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and regularly check for vulnerabilities.
4. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS for all communications.
5. **Sensitive Data**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials) to the repository.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information.

## Security-Related Configuration

The project includes several security-related configurations:

1. **CORS Settings**: Properly configured in the backend to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse.
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms.

## Third-Party Security Dependencies

This project relies on the following third-party security tools and libraries:

1. **Auth0**: For authentication and authorization
2. **Helmet.js**: For securing HTTP headers
3. **express-rate-limit**: For API rate limiting
4. **bcrypt**: For password hashing

## Security Updates

Security updates and announcements will be published in:

1. Release notes
2. Security advisories on GitHub
3. The project's official communication channels
