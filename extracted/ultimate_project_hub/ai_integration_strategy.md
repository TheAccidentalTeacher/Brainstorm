# AI Integration Strategy

## 1. AI Vision & Philosophy

### 1.1 Core AI Principles

The Ultimate Project & Brainstorm Hub's AI integration is guided by these fundamental principles:

1. **Adaptive Intelligence**: The AI should learn and adapt to each user and team's unique working style, communication patterns, and preferences.
